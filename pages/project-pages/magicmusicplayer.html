				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>
					As the name suggests this is a music player.<br/>
					It is designed to provide a fully featured player, with everything that is known from popular applications like Spotify, Deezer and others. The only differene here is, that it is a local music player, so that it is not able to play music from the web (at least it is not planned yet).<br/>
					Current version: v1.2_alpha
				</p>
				<h3>Goals of the project</h3>
				<p>
					The project has two main goals.<br/><br/>
					First of all I want to create a music application, which I can run on my windows machines and which works the way I believe is better than other players. Because every player I tried had something I did not like about it. Regardless of the fact that an application was a local player as well, or an online player like Spotify.<br/><br/>
					The second goal is to create an Open-Source music player, which can be used by everyone and does not come with any kind of online features, which track what you are doing, listening to, or anything similar and then send it to some obscure servers.<br/><br/>
					The main learning goal for the project is to get a better understanding about Java and JavaFX for practical application building (in contrast to Java programming at university).<br/><br/>
				</p>
				<h3>Roadmap</h3>
				<p>
					At the moment this project is on hold. Due to a missing ability of the JavaFX library to allow jumping to time stamps with a majority of mp3 file, one of the main features, namely the timeline, does not work.<br><br>
					At some point I will rewrite this music player in a different programming language, which does not have this limitation. At the moment React-Native looks very promising, as porting to different platforms is very powerful.
